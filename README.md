# VIBING

This is the code repository for the CS 2790R project `VIBING: Visual INtuition-Based Interaction for Natural Generation from Painters & Srtists` at Harvard University.

This project is powered by [`Svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte).

<!-- ## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npx sv create

# create a new project in my-app
npx sv create my-app
``` -->

## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install` , start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

**Please note that the production version hasn't been tested yet. Our user studies are based on the dev version. We are continuing developing this application!**

~~To create a production version of your app:~~

```bash
# npm run build
```

~~You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.~~

> ~~To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.~~

## Demo
Once the service is running with `npm run dev`, you may access the application through the browser. The default port would be `5173`. The final version of our application can be accessed with [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) and the baseline system is at [http://localhost:5173/vibing_baseline](http://localhost:5173/vibing_baseline).
